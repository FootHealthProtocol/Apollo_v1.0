Title: Consensus best practices for lower extremity health professionals

Website: www.LowerExtremityConsensus.com redirected to www.RunningApollo.com/bestpractices

As a global community of lower extremity health professionals, we aspire to hold ourselves to a higher standard of care and restore a reputation of effectiveness. Treating symptoms while ignoring root causes is no longer acceptable and establishing consensus best practices for the prevention and resolution of lower extremity dysfunction is essential. We believe six critical practices serve as a gold standard for effective care and must be adopted by all professionals. Consensus is achieved through professional endorsement as a method to signal agreement and validate effectiveness. Each criticial practice includes a reference document which offers a deeper explanation and practical guidance for application. Reference documents are updated monthly based on feedback and best practices are reviewed quarterly by a council of professionals from varying specialties. 

Health professional is defined as any individual whose primary profession is helping individuals restore natural function. Natural function is the default state of human physiology and is in our context can be defined as a strong, stable, mobile, resilient lower extremity that is free of longstanding pain. Lower extremity is defined as a subsystem of the body which includes hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle and foot. In accordance with the SAID principle, restoration of natural function requires the lower extremity to be protected from unnatural behaviours and exposed to natural behaviours [1].

Health professionals are expected to apply best practices in their own lives and to orient their practice around helping individuals restore natural function. While we acknowledge pain as a major consideration, improved function must remain the primary objective. Best practices include footwear education, functional movement assessments, pain education and guidance on making sustainable lifestyle changes. If you are a health professional and agree with these best practices, please consider helping us build consensus by endorsing them. If you disagree with them, please consider participating in a quarterly roundtable discussion with fellow professionals to share your disagreement.
