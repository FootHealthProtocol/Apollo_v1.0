Profile: young family

I'm a 35 year old father of a young family. My wife and I apply Apollo to optimize our lower extremity health

We design our home to make protocol application effortless. By engineering our environment, we default to natural behaviours

Here are our cheat codes:
- Ground living home. No chairs or couches, lots of comfortable ground living areas with low tables and meditation cushions
- Coffee squats: every morning we do some squats while percolating our coffee
- We got rid of all unnatural shoes and wear only natural footwear. We spend time barefoot outside regularly
- We start our days with a 30 minute family walk early morning to get sun in our eyes and fresh air to start the day

The result:
- Resolution of foot and ankle problems
- Confidence that our bodies are resilient and we can handle any physical challenge we're faced with
- No hesitation to go on a big hike or intense games of pickleball. Full confidence in our bodies
- No more reliance on spending money and time to see rehab professionals to feel better if we face pain. We know how to troubleshoot and self regulate
