Protocol primitive for athletes

- Adopt a low time preference in my training and competitive endeavours
- Eliminate unnatural shoes. Spend time barefoot and wear natural footwear
- Consistently show up for a daily self directed session to upgrade my lower body (min is ideal, can be included in warmup)
- Daily session includes elements of foot reconditioning, balance training, squat restoration, and time on the ground
- Until I can balance on 1 leg barefoot with my eyes closed for 90 seconds, I work on my balance daily
- Until I can adopt a natural resting squat position for 5 minutes, I work on my squat daily
- I aspire to sit in chairs for less than 2 hours per day
