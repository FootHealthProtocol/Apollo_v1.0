Protocol primitive for athletes

It's about doing the simple things well and doing them consistently

1. LOW TIME PREFERENCE

- Think long term 
- Respect the process
- Results come over time by doing the right things everyday and avoiding things that hinder performance (mainly bad shoes and chair sitting)

2. FOOTWEAR

- Stop wearing unnatural shoes. Avoid shoes that aren't shaped like feet, are stiff, have an elevated heel, thick sole or artificial support
- Spend time barefoot and wear natural shoes when you need to protect your feet
- Natural shoes are foot shaped, flat, flexible, and have a thin sole
- Check out www.SoleFreedom.ca -> They are running apollo and only sell natural shoes

3. DAILY SESSION

- Show up for a daily session focused on upgrading your lower body. 30 minutes a day for professional athletes is a mininum, can be included in warmup
- Include elements of foot reconditioning, balance training, squat restoration and time on the ground. Prioritize weakest elements

Extras:
- Limit chair sitting to 2hrs or less per day when able. Sit on the ground, stand or kneel

Screens:
- Can you stand on 1 leg barefoot with your eyes closed for 90 seconds without making an error? If no, train your balance everyday until you can
- Can you lower into a resting squat position (barefoot, hip width, feet flat and straight) and hang out there for 5 miniutes comfortably? If not, work on your squat position everyday untilyou can
