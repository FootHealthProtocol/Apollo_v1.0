1. INTRODUCTION

Resolving foot pain has come to rely almost exclusively on disease care experts serving as trusted authorities to diagnose and treat problems. 

With 75% of shod individuals suffering from foot pain at some point in their lives, the ineffectiveness of ignoring the root cause of problems is a big problem.

Disease care incentivizes a palliative approach which focuses on short term symptom mitigation while ignoring unnatural footwear as a root cause of foot dysfunction. 


The word radical comes the Latin word radicalis which meant "relating to a root". 

In our context, radical signifies a reversion back to first principles and focusing on the root cause of foot dysfunction. 

Radical also makes reference to the fact that a simple approach built on first principles is a radical shift from our current paradigm of complex, ineffective treatments that offer short term benefits while ignoring long term unintended negative consequences. 

Treating symptoms of disease while ignoring the root cause is no longer meeting a reasonable standard of care.


Credentialed professionals are efficient in providing care but fail to acknowledge that the their competency is in techniques that are now outdated and ineffective in achieving positive health outcomes in the long term. 

An empowering, action oriented protocol based in first principles of biology is needed instead of trust in a disease care system that no longer serves the interests of indivduals.


Our feet abide by the same biological axioms as any other body part yet they are currently treated in a fundamentally different way. 

If the natural default state of the human body is to be free of pain and dysfunction, why then do 75%+ of shod people develop foot pain over the course of their life? 

If the body is self healing and self organizing, the only answer to this problem is that unnatural inputs are disrupting the healthy biology we are each given at birth. 

With a basic understanding of foot function and the observation that over 90% of modern humans are wearing unnatural footwear, it becomes painfully obvious why so many people develop dysfunctional feet.
