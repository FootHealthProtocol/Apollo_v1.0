Trimmed from Whitepaper:

ABSTRACT

- Simple, effective lower body protocol would allow individuals to reclaim responsibility for taking care of their feet without depending on professionals who have been trained to treat symptoms of foot dysfunction without addressing the root cause. 

- A paradigm shift is currently underway in how we think of health broadly and foot health specifically. Instead of simply diagnosing problems and treating symptoms (disease care), professionals are beginning to help their patients and clients take better care of themselves (healthcare). 

- This shift is a much needed change to help us move towards better health. Optimal health is the output of exposing our bodies to natural behaviours that align with our biology. 

- Within the domain of foot health, it is the duty of care and responsibility of health professionals to protect those they serve from the harmful effects of unnatural footwear. 

- By increasing awareness, respecting first principles, focusing on the essentials and designing aligned incentives, we have an opportunity to prevent and resolve the vast majority of foot dysfunction. 

We believe a low time preference, reducing time spent in unnatural footwear annd chair sitting, and a consistent daily session are fundamental requirements to restore healthy feet and a resilient, functional lower body.

3. PARADIGM SHIFT





--> COMPLETE REBUILD
OLD:


Today's predominant system of disease care revolves around the diagnosis of disease and treatment of symptoms. 

Disease care professionals are trained and financially incentivized to treat symptoms without addressing the root cause of dysfunction. 

Even with good people and good intentions, this system is disempowering, myopically focused on short term suppression of symptoms, and built on a framework of financial incentives that reward intervention instead of positive long term health outcomes. 

While many professionals working in disease care view themselves as healthcare professionals, the truth is that disease care has nothing to do with health and disease care professionals are in fact not trained to address root causes while being financially dis-incentivized to help patients heal.


Time preference is a term from economics used to describe the relative value we place on the present moment versus the future. 

Someone with a high time preference cares more about the present than the future and someone with a low time preference prioritizes the future over the present moment. 

For example, when offered a drug that will reduce pain in the short term but will create more problems in the long term, someone with high time preference will choose to feel better right now regardless of the long term consequences whereas someone with a low time preference will accept feeling less comfortable in the present moment in order to have a better long term outcome. 

Disease care has a high time preference bias. 

Disease care offers interventions that manage symptoms in the short term while creating unintended negative consequences in the long term. 

A blind spot about long term consequences is created because research measures short term effects while rarely (if ever) measuring long term issues that are created.


Improving one's health is a long term endeavour that requires a low time preference. 

Being healthy requires us to forfeit the donut today in order to have better health tomorrow. 

It requires us to forfeit the pain medication today so we can continue receiving the crucial feedback loop of pain and engage with the process of rebuilding capacity. 

The paradigm shift from disease care to health care is fundamentally a return to low time preference thinking and the adoption of a long term mindset. 

In contrast to disease care, health care revolves around education and empowering individuals to take better care of themselves. 

By helping people understand the root cause of problems and offering effective guidance, healthcare empowers individuals to reclaim responsibility for their well being by enabling them to make lifestyle choices that support better health. 

Healthcare places primary responsibility back on the patient/client, who are the only ones capable of making better daily decisions.


Disease care creates dependence on "experts" who must intervene with short term measures to ease pain which comes at the expense of long term health. 

Health care fosters independence by offering individuals an increased ability to respond effectively to the challenges they face. 

Instead of focusing on pain, the objective is to improve long term function and resilience while understanding that pain is our most powerful guide along the process of healing. 

In our instant gratification culture, disease care appeases to our desire to take shortcuts and to feel better today regardless of consequences that may come tomorrow. 

Health care is a return to rational discipline and asks us to prioritize the future over the present moment. 

Health is a long term endeavor and requires a long term mindset if we are to meaningfully improve our well being. 

Focusing on eliminating the root cause of problems instead of simply treating the symptoms is a return to effectiveness. 

Helping people take better care of themselves requires us to educate our patients about eliminating unnatural inputs causing issues and reincorporating natural inputs that nudge our bodies to adapt back to default, healthy settings.

5. TIME PREFERENCE

- A high time preference is a present moment bias, and a low time preference is a future oriented bias.

RESPONSIBILITY (non existent as a section heading as of v0.95)

Developing better health requires each of us to accept responsibility for taking care of our bodies. 

The responsibility of health professionals is to offer truthful, applicable guidance to the individuals they serve. 

With improved awareness, we collectively gain the ability to respond effectively to foot health challenges we may face. 

This whitepaper aims to improve awareneness of foot health fundamentals so every human has access to truthful, simple information that can be applied in day to day life.


The ability to effectively respond to a problem first requires an understanding of the problem. 

It is the responsibility of individuals to learn how their body adapts and functions and to make apropriate footwear choices. 

It is the responsibility of health professionals to understand how the body functions so they can effectively guide those they serve towards making better lifestyle choices. 


Health professional is defined as any individual who earns the majority of their income from helping others improve their health. 

It is the responsibility of these individuals to be informed, and to offer guidance that helps those they serve make better decisions in their day to day lives. 

Based on that definition, health professionals include movement coaches, yoga instructors, physicians, physiotherapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, podiatrists and many more professions who aspire to empower those they serve with information that guides healthy behaviour change.

In order to preserve a reputation of competence, disease care professionals must shift their approach to align with the health care paradigm that has emerged.

Professionals must elevate their understanding of feet in order to effectively guide patients as they respond to the challenge of foot dysfunction.

INPUTS (non existent as a section heading as of v0.95)

- “we are how we move”

- The health and function of our bodies is a direct reflection of how we use our biology.

- According to first principles, when the body is exposed to natural inputs, the result is natural outputs.

- Converselt when the body is exposed to unnatural inputs, the result is unnatural outputs.

- Health and resilience are natural outputs.

- Sustained pain and disease are unnatural outputs. 

- the two primary natural inputs required by the lower body for foot health are varied movement and load.

- Our primitive biology is optimized for a world where humans are barefoot, walk extended distances each day on foot and are consistently exposed to a wide variety of surfaces.

- These natural behaviours create varied loads and movement positions which serve as inputs for our lower body system.

- The mismatch between the modern world today and the primitive world to which human biology is adapted for is what creates problems.

- The human body adapts impartially and unapologetically to the inputs provided to it and doesn’t care if the result is pain and dysfunction.

- Human feet require varied movement and load in the lower body to remain functional, strong and resilient.

- Despite being an incredibly important topic to understand as children, most are tought very little about health and how to care for our biology through the lifestyle we choose to live.

- Unnatural shoes and excessive chair sitting disrupt exposure to varied movement and load that are required for healthy feet.

DUTY OF CARE (non existent as a section heading as of v0.95)


It is the duty of health professionals to effectively care for those they serve to the best of their ability.

Caring means understanding the most current information and protecting individuals from behaviours that harm their health. 

By providing truthful, applicable education, we enable them to make wise choices and take better care of their bodies. 

Within the context of foot health, our primary duty is to protect them from the dangers of unnatural footwear that disables, deforms and damages their feet. 

Failing to advocate natural footwear is a failure in upholding our duty of care. 

When we learn better, we do better. 

Regardless of our current perspective when it comes to feet, we owe it to those we serve and are duty bound to constantly upgrade our understanding and to base our guidance on the most truthful protocol that respects fundamental laws of biology.

As a community of health professionals, it's our duty to do better and to protect our patients from the harmful effects of unnatural footwear instead of simply treating the symptoms created by shoes that disrespect our biology.


- Best practices are a standard or a set of guidelines that are known to produce good outcomes if followed. 

- Assessing our patients barefoot, educating them about natural footwear and warning them about the dangers of unnatural footwear are the simple yet effective best practices that enable us to achieve good outcomes. 

It’s no longer acceptable to ignore foot health. 

A simple 60 second conversation can dramatically change a persons understanding of how to care for their feet and empower them to protect themselves from potentially debilitating foot problems in future.

8. RESPONSIBILITY

- The price is health is responsibility. 

- Individuals must accept that their personal health is their responsibility 

- In order to do better as a community of professionals, we must first unlearn information that no longer aligns with healthcare, and update our understanding so we can build our ability to effectively guide those we serve towards better health. 

- Within the context of foot health, we must understand the effects of our footwear choices on foot health and advocate wearing footwear that supports a healthy foundation. 

- As individuals, our health is fundamentally our responsibility. 

- As health professionals, our responsibility to those we serve is to offer truthful, helpful, applicable education that empowers them to make wise lifestyle choices.
