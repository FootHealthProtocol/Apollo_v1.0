5. TIME PREFERENCE

Time preference is a term that describes our temporal orientation when making decisions. 

High time preference thinking prioritizes the present moment, whereas low time preference thinking delays present gratification and places more emphasis on the future. 

The largest influence on our time preference is the hardness of the money we use to save our time.

The pursuit of health is a long term endeavour that requires infividuals to adopt a low time preference thinking. 

Disease care is high time preference, healthcare is low time preference. 


Viewing pain as the enemy and something to be eliminated is a high time preference perspective. 

Disease care is built on incentives that orient professionals to treating symptoms in order to reduce pain.

In contrast, viewing pain as a teacher to be learned from is a low time preference perspective. 

If individuals change how they view pain, they become empowered to explore what is causing the pain and to make changes to eliminate the root causes. 

Learning about how the human body works, how it adapts and changing behaviours to align with biology is low time preference.

Enduring discomfort today and spending time making sustainable changes for better health tomorrow is the path to develop better health.

The hardest form of money ever created by humans is Bitcoin. Adopting the hardest money is the most powerful way to lower our time preference in life overall.
