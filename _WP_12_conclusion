12. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a simple proof of work protocol for optimizing lower extremity function that individuals can implement without relying on disease care experts.

We began by identifying the cultural awareness gap with regard to the lower extremity and the perverse incentives created by the current disease care system. 

By understanding first principles of biology, we develop a foundational basis for the 3 fundamental elements that must be applied to restore natural lower extremity function.

We for this protocol to be applied, scruitinized and peer validated in order to achieve a consensus among health professionals as best practice.
