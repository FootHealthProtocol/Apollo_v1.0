8. Natural inputs

Once unnatural inoputs have been reduced, natural inputs may be added.

For the lower extremity, three natural inputs are essential: walking, time spent barefoot, time on the ground.

Developing a healthy lower body is about constantly moving in the direction of better inoputs. 

It matters less how much time you spend walking, barefoot or on the ground than the fact that you are doing those things in increasing amounts over time.

Replace netflix time with a podcast when walking. Replace chair sitting time wth time on the ground. 

Walking is a fundamental human movement. To walk is to be human.
