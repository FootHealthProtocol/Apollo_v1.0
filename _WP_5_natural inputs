5. NATURAL INPUTS

“we are how we move”

The health and function of our bodies is a direct reflection of how we use our biology.

According to our first principles, if expose the body to natural inputs, the result is natural outputs.

If we expose our bodies to unnatural inputs, the result is unnatural outputs.

Health and resilience are natural outputs.

Sustained pain and disease are unnatural outputs. 


In the context of feet, the two primary natural inputs required for foot health are varied movement and load.

Our primitive biology is optimized for a world where humans are barefoot, walk extended distances each day on foot and are consistently exposed to a wide variety of surfaces.

These behaviours naturally create varied loads and movement positions which serve as inputs for our system.

The mismatch between our world today and the world in which our biology has been adapted to is what creates problems.

Our bodies adapt impartially and unapologetically to the inputs we provide it and doesn’t care if that results in pain and dysfunction.

Human feet require movement and load to remain mobile and strong.

Unnatural shoes and excessive chair sitting disrupt our exposure to varied movement and loading that are required for healthy feet.

Remove the unnatural inputs and our biology immediately begins adapting back to default settings.
