5. NATURAL INPUTS

“we are how we move”

The health and function of our bodies is a direct reflection of how we use our biology.

According to first principles, when the body is exposed to natural inputs, the result is natural outputs.

Converselt when the body is exposed to unnatural inputs, the result is unnatural outputs.

Health and resilience are natural outputs.

Sustained pain and disease are unnatural outputs. 


In the context of feet, the two primary natural inputs required by the lower body for foot health are varied movement and load.

Our primitive biology is optimized for a world where humans are barefoot, walk extended distances each day on foot and are consistently exposed to a wide variety of surfaces.

These behaviours naturally create varied loads and movement positions which serve as inputs for our lower body system.

The mismatch between the modern world today and the primitive world to which human biology is adapted for is what creates problems.

The human body adapts impartially and unapologetically to the inputs provides to it and doesn’t care if the result is pain and dysfunction.

Human feet require varied movement and load in the lower body to remain functional, strong and resilient.

Unnatural shoes and excessive chair sitting disrupt exposure to varied movement and load that are required for healthy feet.

Reduce the unnatural inputs and our biology immediately begins adapting back to default settings.
