A simple and effective lower extremity protocol would allow individuals to prevent and resolve injury without relying on disease care professionals trained to treat symptoms without addressing the root cause of dysfunction.

The protocol could be validated by peers and applied by health professionals to deliver effective guidance to those they serve. 

The majority of shod humans currently wear shoes that disable and damage their feet, and 75% develop foot issues over the course of a lifetime.

We propose a solution to the problem by using peer validated proof of work software grounded in first prinicples that can be easily applied by any human.

This protocol seeks to update our collective understanding of human health and presents a radical approach for preventing and resolving lower extremity dysfunction. 

It is our assertion that the ultimate form of healthcare occurrs when individuals accept responsibility for aligning their behaviours with human biology.

In order to reclaim responsibility for their health, individuals require truthful and effective behavioural software which they can apply and validate experientially.

Protocol fundamentals are low time preference, reduction of unnatural inputs and addition of natural inputs. 

Through peer validation, protocol effectiveness will create natural incentives for the development of products and services that support successful application.   

Each individual will have their own optimal application of the protocol but the fundamentals must be respected in order to achieve effectiveness.
