Abstract. 

A simple and effective foot health protocol would allow individuals to prevent and resolve foot dysfuncton without relying on experts who are trained to treat symptoms without addressing the root cause of dysfunction.

The protocol offers a peer validated approach that can be applied by professionals to deliver effective foot health guidance to those they serve. 

The majority of shod humans humans currently wear shoes that deform, disable and damage their feet, and 75% develop foot issues over the course of a lifetime.

We propose a solution to the problem by using peer validated proof of work software grounded in first prinicples that can be easily applied by any human.

This protocol seeks to update our collective understanding of human feet and present a radical approach for preventing and resolving foot dysfunction. 

It is our assertion that the ultimate form of healthcare is accepting responsibility for aligning our behaviours with our biology.

In order to reclaim responsibility for their well being, individuals require truthful and effective behavioural software which they can apply in their own lives.

Protocol fundamentals are low time preference, reduction of unnatural inputs and addition of natural inputs. 

Each individual will have their own optimal application of the protocol but the fundamentals must be respected in order to achieve effectiveness.
