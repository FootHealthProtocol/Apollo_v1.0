5. INPUTS

The function, capacity and health of our body at any moment is a predictable and direct reflection of the inputs we provide it. 

This principle applies equally to feet whereby the function and health of our feet is the resulting output of the inputs we provide our lower body.

Strong, stable, adaptable, resilent feet are the result of natural inputs.

Weak, unstable, stiff, injury prone feet are the result of unnatural inputs.

Natural inputs align with and optimize our biology while unnatural inputs violate and disable our biology. 

While health is important to understand in order to live a pleasant life, most people understand very little about how to care for their bodies.

Without understanding how the body adapts, individuals are not capable of making wise choises when it comes to foot health.

In order to optimize foot health, individuals must reduce unnatural inputs and increase natural inputs.

By reducing exposure to unnatural footwear and time spent sitting in chairs, the primary root causes of foot dysfunction are removed.

By increasing movement and load variety through acitivites like walking, balance training, time spent barefoot and time on the ground, natural foot function can be restored. 

Developing better foot health is the process of reducing unnatural behaviors and adopting a lifestyle rich in natural inputs so our biology can begin adapting back to default settings.
