Movement education reference

Objective: Educate individuals about the importance of natural movement and the harmful consequences of prolonged chair sitting on lower body function

Key points to cover in 3 minutes or less:

- The body adapts to the positions we put it in most frequently
- Being able to move naturally requires a lifestyle filled with natural human movement
- Sitting in chairs for prolonged periods of time each day creates unnatural adaptations at the hips which degrades our lower body function
- Chair adaptations increase our risk of injury at the foot, knee and low back
- Spending time on the floor maintains our hip mobility
- Movement screen: handsfree floor stand
- Chair audit

Directives:
- Reduce chair sitting time (10% of waking hours or less)
- Spend time walking and on the ground
- Work towards achieving fundamental human movement standards (handsfree floor stand, balance screen, resting squat position)
