Movement education reference

Objective: Educate individuals about the importance of natural movement and the harmful consequences of prolonged chair sitting on lower body function

Key points to cover:
- The body adapts to the positions we put it in most frequently
- Being able to move naturally requires a lifestyle rich in natural movement
- Natural movement can be defined as varied movement that explores a broad spectrum of joint positions and load
- Sitting in chairs for long periods of time creates unnatural adaptations at the hips which degrades our lower body function and increases risk of foot, knee and low back injuries
- Sitting on the ground is a natural movement behaviour which maintains our hip mobility
- Walking in natural footwear is one of the most powerful ways to recalibrate the lower body back to default, healthy settings

Directives:
- Reduce chair sitting time to 10% or less of waking hours)
- Replace chair sitting with time on the ground, kneeling, squatting or walking
- Work towards achieving fundamental human movement standards on all movement screens

Walking:
- Despite it's simplicity, walking is one of the most powerful ways to restore a healthy lower body
- Walking is such a deeply natural human movement that one could say that to walk is to be human
- In my experience, people can quite literally walk away from lower body problems. For some it will take many hours of walking, for others it will take less
- Walking is one of the most accessible, low risk and powerful activities that humans can do to bost mental and physical health
- It can be done everyday, anytime, in long or short durations, with little preparation, zero equipment and is free
- Humans have been shown to do better on tests of memory and attention after a walk
- We can change the pace of our thinking with the pace of a walk. Faster walking = faster thinking, slower walking = slower thinking
- A single walk can improve our sleep, our thinking, our ability to learn and reduce anxiety

Tools:
- Chair audit. An awareness excercise to log the amount of daily chair sitting time for 7 days
