10. CONSENSUS

To our knowledge there is currently no truthful, simple, and applicable education resource that helps individuals restore a healthy lower body. 

There is also a significant lack of consensus agreement among professionals regarding principles that effectively prevent and resolve lower extremity dysfunction.

While we acknoweldge the merits of academic peer review as a method of evaluating the validity and quality of research articles, we also acklnowledge the shortcomings of traditional peer review including perverse funding incentives and poor application relevance to broad populations.

Our solution to the problems of traditional peer review is to achieve consensus agreement through peer validated behavioural software. 

By applying protocol principles, individuals can experientially validate the software and signal their agreement via formal endorsement or simply by integrating the software into their lives and into their professional practice. 

It is essential to align our actions with biological axioms that govern how human physiology adapts to inputs it receives.

A focus on principles is lacking within disease care education institutions which has led to treatment approaches that are ineffective at best and harmful at worst when unintended long term consequences are considered. 

Through peer validated consensus, we aspire to create foundational best practices that govern how we approach the prevention and resolution of lower extremity dysfunction.
