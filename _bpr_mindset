Mindset education reference

Objective: Educate individuals about the process of restoring health and importance of adopting a low time preference

Key points to cover:
- Developing better health is a process that requires consistency and patience
- By zooming out and thinking long term, individuals can focus on taking little steps everyday
- Improving behaviours by 1% everyday results in significant compounded effects over time
- Writing daily notes in a logbook about what we are doing, how we feel and changes that are happening is a powerful tool to measure progress
- Focus first on subtracting unnatural behaviours in order to remove root causes then gradually add natural behaviours that offer your body better inputs 

Directives:
- Pick a natural behaviour and start by doing it 20 minutes a day
- Start with a daily 20 minute walk or some balance play
- Join a community or purchase a program that can help move you along your journey

MORE INFORMATION

- Making small, sustainable improvements in our daily behaviours is a more effective strategy than attempting radical changes which often end up being temporary
- Attention and effort are required in small amounts everyday in order to make meaningful improvements over time
- Writing down what youre doing and how youre feeling in a notebook is a very powerful way of reflecting on your journey and troubleshooting challenges
- Adopting the mindset that health is a process, not a destination can be very valuable. The focus isn't our current state but the direction we are moving in


DAILY SESSION
- An intentional daily session dedicated to learning and taking action
- Start with 20 minutes and increase as able
- Examples: walking ourtside, balance training, free play, basic foot reconditioning of strength & mobility, squat restoration
- Initial daily sessions should involve subtraction of unnatural behaviours

DAILY LOG
- A daily journal that records what you are doing each day, how you feel and how you want to progress
- Placing this journal somewhere visible acts as a daily prompt to make sure your daily session gets done
- Sharing your data in this journal when visiting a professional allows you to discuss what you have been doing, changes in symptoms and obstacles you're facing
