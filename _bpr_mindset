Mindset education reference

Objective: Educate individuals about the importance of adopting a long term mindset

Key points to cover:
- Developing better health is a process that requires consistency and patience
- Thinking long term helps us focus on taking little steps everyday
- Improving behaviours by 1% everyday results in significant compounded effects over time
- Writing daily notes in a logbook about what we are doing, how we feel and changes that are happening is a powerful tool to measure progress
- Focus first on subtracting unnatural behaviours in order to remove root causes then gradually add natural behaviours that support the restoration of natural function

Directives:
- Focus on doing something everyday that benefits your health
- A 20 minute walk in natural shoes is a great start

MORE INFORMATION

- Making small, sustainable improvements in our daily behaviours is a more effective strategy than attempting radical changes which often end up being temporary
- Attention and effort are required in small amounts everyday in order to make meaningful improvements over time
- Writing down what youre doing and how youre feeling in a notebook is a very powerful way of reflecting on your journey and troubleshooting challenges
- Adopting the mindset that health is a process, not a destination can be very valuable. The focus isn't our current state but the direction we are moving in


DAILY SESSION
- An intentional daily session dedicated to learning and taking action
- Start with 20 minutes and increase as able
- Examples: walking ourtside, balance training, free play, basic foot reconditioning of strength & mobility, squat restoration
- Initial daily sessions should involve subtraction of unnatural behaviours

DAILY LOG
- A daily journal that records what you are doing each day, how you feel and how you want to progress
- Placing this journal somewhere visible acts as a daily prompt to make sure your daily session gets done
- Sharing your data in this journal when visiting a professional allows you to discuss what you have been doing, changes in symptoms and obstacles you're facing
