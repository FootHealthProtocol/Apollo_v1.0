5. INPUTS

The function, capacity and health of our body at any moment is a predictable and direct reflection of the inputs we provide it. 

This same principle applies to feet whereby the function and health of our feet is the output of the inputs we provide our lower body.

Strong, stable, adaptable, resilent feet are the output of natural inputs, while weak, unstable, stiff and injury prone feet are the output of unnatural inputs.

Natural inputs align with and optimize our biology while unnatural inputs violate and disable our biology. 

Despite being an incredibly important topic to understand as children, most are tought very little about health and how to care for our biology through the lifestyle we choose to live.


In order to optimize foot health, individuals must reduce unnatural inputs and increase natural inputs.

By reducing exposure to unnatural footwear and time spent sitting in chairs, the primary root causes of foot dysfunction are removed.

By increasing movement and load variety through acitivites like walking, balance training, time spent barefoot and time on the ground, natural foot function can be restored. 



Unnatural shoes and excessive chair sitting disrupt exposure to varied movement and load that are required for healthy feet.

Reduce the unnatural inputs and our biology immediately begins adapting back to default settings. 

TRIMMED:
- “we are how we move”

- The health and function of our bodies is a direct reflection of how we use our biology.

- According to first principles, when the body is exposed to natural inputs, the result is natural outputs.

- Converselt when the body is exposed to unnatural inputs, the result is unnatural outputs.

- Health and resilience are natural outputs.

- Sustained pain and disease are unnatural outputs. 

- the two primary natural inputs required by the lower body for foot health are varied movement and load.

- Our primitive biology is optimized for a world where humans are barefoot, walk extended distances each day on foot and are consistently exposed to a wide variety of surfaces.

- These natural behaviours create varied loads and movement positions which serve as inputs for our lower body system.

- The mismatch between the modern world today and the primitive world to which human biology is adapted for is what creates problems.

- The human body adapts impartially and unapologetically to the inputs provided to it and doesn’t care if the result is pain and dysfunction.

- Human feet require varied movement and load in the lower body to remain functional, strong and resilient.
