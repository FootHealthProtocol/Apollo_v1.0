Abstract. 

A simple, effective lower body protocol would allow individuals to reclaim responsibility for taking care of their feet without depending on professionals who have been trained to treat symptoms of foot dysfunction without addressing the root cause. 

The protocol would also serve as a peer validated approach for professionals who seek to offer effective foot health guidance to those they serve. Over 90% of shod humans currently wear shoes that literally deform, disable and damage their feet. 

One has only to observe the footwear worn by the public to validate this shocking reality. With that fact considered, itâ€™s unsurprising that roughly 75% of people develop foot problems at some point in their lives.


This protocol seeks to update our collective understanding of human feet and present a radical approach to preventing and resolving foot dysfunction. 

A paradigm shift is currently underway in how we think of health broadly and foot health specifically. Instead of simply diagnosing problems and treating symptoms (disease care), professionals are beginning to help their patients and clients take better care of themselves (healthcare). 

This shift is a much needed change to help us move towards better health. Optimal health is the output of exposing our bodies to natural behaviours that align with our biology. 

Within the domain of foot health, it is the duty of care and responsibility of health professionals to protect those they serve from the harmful effects of unnatural footwear. 

By increasing awareness, respecting first principles, focusing on the essentials and designing aligned incentives, we have an opportunity to prevent and resolve the vast majority of foot dysfunction.
