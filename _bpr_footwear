Footwear education reference

Objective: Educate individuals about the importance of natural footwear and the dangers of unnatural footwear on lower body function, foot health and posture


Key points to cover in 3 minutes or less:

- Feet are the foundation of the lower extremity. They serve as the foundation and primary sensory for the lower body system
- The footwear we wear is the primary determinant of our foot health
- Wearing unnatural shoes damages, disables and deforms our feet
- Wearing natural footwear protects our feet while supporting the restoration of natural foot function
- Unnatural footwear is pointed, ramped, stiff, supportive and has a thick sole (deeper explanation below)
- Natural footwear is foot shaped, flat, flexible and has a thin sole (deeper explanation below)

Directives:
- Reduce time in unnatural footwear
- Wear natural footwear

Deeper explanation of unnatural and natural footwear features:


Features of unnatural footwear (to be avoided)

---> POINTED: Narrowest at the tip of the toes (which disrupts toe alignment)

---> RAMPED: Higher at the heel than at the toes (which loads knees and low back)

---> SUPPORTIVE: artificial support for the arch of the foot (which will weaken feet over time)

---> STIFF: Resistance to being bent, folded or twisted (which will stiffen the 33 joints in each foot)

---> THICK SOLE: Thick layer of rubber, foam or air between sole of the foot and the ground (which destabilizes the body and distorts essential ground feedback signals)

---> FLOPPY: Not solidly attached to your foot. Example: flip flops (aka thongs in Australia). (which disables natural movement patters)

Features of natural footwear (the five F's)

---> FOOT SHAPED: The default shape of human feet is widest at the tip of the toes. Wear that are widest at the tip of the toes, not shoes that compress your toes together

---> FLAT: Same height at the heel and toes (aka "zero drop"). Flat footbed (aka no "arch support")

---> FLEXIBLE: Can be bent, folded or twisted with litte resistance (which allows the 33 joints in each foot to move)

---> FEEL: Thin layer of material between sole of the foot and the ground. No cushioning (which enables sensory transmission)

---> FIXED: Solidly attached to your foot (which allows natural movement)
