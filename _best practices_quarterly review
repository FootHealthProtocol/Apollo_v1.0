Thanks for being here

This is a safe space for disagreement and we encourage everyone to speak their truth

We aspire to hold ourselves to a higher standard

We can (and should) disagree on specifics but we must agree on the fundamentals

Best practices are the essential fundamentals for professional effectiveness

As we shift from disease care to healthcare we have an opportunity to pioneer a new path

Best practices are the gold standard expectation for lower extremity health professionals

What is a health professional? Define it

If you agree with best practices, please help us build consensus by endorsing them

Concept: behaviour as software

A major goal is to have rehab and medical schools endorse and teach best practices in their programs

QUESTIONS:
- What is an example of how you apply a best practice in your work?
- Share a case
- Share an insight
- Share a conflicting opinion
