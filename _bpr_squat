Context:
- The ability to lower into and out of a resting squat position demonstrates functional capacity in the lower body. 
- The resting squat position serves as a master screen that measures baseline capacity the the feet, ankles, knees and hips. It also assesses pelvic control. 
- The inability to lower into and out of a resting squat position is an indicator that something fundamental is missing within the lower body system.


Prompt:
- Begin barefoot on firm level ground standing hip width apart with feet parallel
- Slowly lower down into a resting squat position without changing foot position or letting your heels lift up off the ground
- Stay in a comfortable, relaxed resting squat for 30 seconds while taking deep, calm breaths

Scoring: Binary - Yes or No
- YES: abile to complete the screen with no pain

Standard: The ability to slowly lower into a resting squat position, maintain it comfortably for 30 seconds and then slowly rise out of the squat with no pain

Reasonable aspiration: spend 2 minutes everyday in a resting squat position

While the inability to lower into a resting squat doesn't tell us exactly what isn't functioning, it does tell us that there is a restriction within the lower body system


Qualitative and quantitative scoring

Observations:


RAW:
---> Resting squat

Prompt: 
- Barefoot on flat, hard ground
- Stand hip width apart with feet parallel and slowly lower down into a resting squat position while keeping feet parallel and heels on the ground
- Spend 2 minutes in the bottom position while taking deep, calm breaths

Questions to ask:
- Do you have any pain?
- What are you feeling?
- What is stopping you from being able to get down into the resting squat?
- Can you take deep, easy breaths?

Qualitative elements: What restrictions are present (pain, ankle mobilty, hip mobility, quad dominance)
- Observations: pelvic position, toes and tibialis anterior activity

Quantitative score: binary yes (they can do it) or no (they cannot do it)

Standard: ability to remain in a deep resting squat position for 2 minutes without strain, pain and while being able to take deep, easy diaphragmatic breaths
