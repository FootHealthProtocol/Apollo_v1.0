The ability to lower into and out of a triple fold is a foundational human movement that demonstrates a baseline capacity at feet, ankles, knees, hips and pelvic control.

Being able to slowly lower into a resting squat position and maintain it for 30 seconds is a powerful master screen for the lower extremity.

Scoring is binary (Y/N) 

While the inability to lower into a resting squat doesn't tell us exactly what isn't functioning, it does tell us that there is a restriction within the lower body system

30 seconds no pain and ability to breathe deeply and calmly

Aspiration: 2 minutes

Prompt:
- Barefoot on hard, flat ground
- Standing hip width apart and feet parallel
- Gradually lower

Qualitative and quantitative scoring

Observations:


RAW:
---> Resting squat

Prompt: 
- Barefoot on flat, hard ground
- Stand hip width apart with feet parallel and slowly lower down into a resting squat position while keeping feet parallel and heels on the ground
- Spend 2 minutes in the bottom position while taking deep, calm breaths

Questions to ask:
- Do you have any pain?
- What are you feeling?
- What is stopping you from being able to get down into the resting squat?
- Can you take deep, easy breaths?

Qualitative elements: What restrictions are present (pain, ankle mobilty, hip mobility, quad dominance)
- Observations: pelvic position, toes and tibialis anterior activity

Quantitative score: binary yes (they can do it) or no (they cannot do it)

Standard: ability to remain in a deep resting squat position for 2 minutes without strain, pain and while being able to take deep, easy diaphragmatic breaths
