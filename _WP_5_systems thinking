5. SYSTEMS THINKING

Systems thinking allows us to make sense of complex human biology by looking at it through a holistic frame of reference and considering relationships rather than oversimplifying into isolated parts. 

Understanding the human foot requires us to consider the entire lower body (navel and below) as an integrated system consisting of multiple interdependent subsystems.


Instead of thinking about what things can be done to a specific body part, we must consider the broader set of factors and interactions contributing to a certain outcome. 

This perspective is well articulated through the musculoskeletal concept of regional interdependence which states that seemingly unrelated impairments in a remote anatomical region may contribute to or be associated with a primary complaint. 


The function of our lower body system is a product of the interactions of different parts, not simply the sum of its parts.Â 

For example, attempting to modify the arch of our feet without considering the impact that our hip has on foot position is naive and far too simplistic to achieve meaningful long term results. 

Systems thinking invites us to understand the interconnectedness of subsystems and feedback loops that govern how our bodies adapt based on the inputs we provide it.


By applying systems thinking to foot health, we consider the lower body as an integrated system whereby no singular element of the system can be meaningfully optimized in isolation of other elements. 

Our feet, ankles, knees, hips and pelvic control are a tightly interlinked network of subsystems that must be considered together in order to effectively resolve dysfunction at the feet. 

A foot conversation must always be a lower body conversation. Isolating the foot is ineffective and futile.
