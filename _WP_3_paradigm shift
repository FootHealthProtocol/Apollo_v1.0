3. PARADIGM SHIFT

Paradigm shift refers to a fundamental change in prevailing viewpoints or practices. 

It's the result of a complete transformation in the underlying assumptions, theories and methodology that guide a field of work. 

By challenging outdated systems, weâ€™re invited to explore new ways of thinking and novel ways of approaching problems.


We are currently transitioning from a paradigm of centralized disease care to an era of decentralized healthcare.

The old system is built on forfeiting responsibility for our health to trusted individuals and companies.

The new system is built on reclaiming responsibility for our well being by understanding principles and applying them to live in alignment with our biology.

Taking care of biology is the ultimate form of healthcare.

Our current system incentivizes the treatment of symptoms with little to no focus on educating about living a lifestyle that aligns with our biology

As we move into a world built on sound money, we will naturally observe a collective shift from high to low time preference when making decisions.

Developing better health is a long term game that can only be mastered through a low time preference approach.


As individuals lose trust in legacy institutions, they must adopt more responsibility for determining truth.

Instead of trusting experts to treat symptoms of their problems, individuals will take responsibility for understanding how to care for their bodies to reduce injury.

Modern medicine is a beautiful application of technology within the realm of acute injury, but it fails miserably in the realm of educating a healthy lifestyle.

Apollo can be applied as a core element of physical education in grade school. 

This is how true change can manifest.


Within the realm of professional education, 

Current incentives to treat symptoms will be replaced by incentives for effectiveness.

Health professionals will aspire to and be compensated for being effective at helping people take responsibility and do the right things. 

Educated individuals will seek guidance from professionals who demonstrate proof of health instead of professionals who demonstrate proof of degree.

We are shifting away from disease care and towards the adoption of proof of work health protocols and the creation of products and services that help people apply the protocols.
