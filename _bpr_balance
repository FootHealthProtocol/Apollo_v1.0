Balance screen reference

---> Single leg eyes closed 60 seconds (begin with eyes open if needed, looking straight)

Prompt:
- Barefoot on flat, hard ground, standing on 1 leg
- Close eyes and maintain balance for 60 seconds
- If not confident, do this close to something the person can hold onto for support if they lose balance
- If you make an error (open eyes, place other foot on the ground, grab onto something with hand), simply regroup and begin again
- Observer: count the amount of errors made in 60 seconds for each side. Do 3 attempts and use average score

Qualitative elements: How stable is the person?, what muscles are visibly being stressed (toe extensors, peroneals, toe flexors), how is their breathing (relaxed vs stressed)

Quantitative score: How many error did the person make?
