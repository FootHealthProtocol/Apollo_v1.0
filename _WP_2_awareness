2. AWARENESS

Understanding how to care for our bodies is essential knowledge to live a good life and yet we learn little if anything about the topic during childhood education.

While such knowledge may not have been necessary when our survival depended on our fitness to hunt, gather and defend our tribes, that is no longer the case.

Modern day conveniences have made it possible to avoid active lifestyles formerly required for survival, but the consequence is an epidemic of lower extremity dysfunction.

By improving awareness about the root causes of lower extremity problems, we empower individuals to make better lifestyle decisions that prevent and resolve lower extremity dysfunction.

We also empower health professionals to adopt a root cause approach to helping those they serve protect themselves from the consequences of these harmful behaviours.

Two unnatural behaviours have been normalized and are causing immense suffering and socioeconomic pain: 1) unnatural footwear, and 2) chair sitting.

Wearing shoes that damage our feet and spending most of our waking hours sitting in chairs have become so normalized that people donâ€™t think to modify them. 


Human hardware is adaptive, self healing and designed to last 100 years.

At birth, our software is perfect and over time we pick up error codes that corrupt our software and can end up causing premature damage to our hardware.

Lower extremity health can be understood by a 6 year old and achieved by any human. 

Apollo is a peer validated proof of work health protocol for the lower extremity.

The longer we have neglected our health, the longer period will be required to restore it.




Awareness that taking care of ourselves is the ultimate form of Healthcare

Awareness of fundamental principles that govern how our bodies adapt

Awareness that treating symptoms of disease has nothing to do with health.

Awareness that normalizing unnatural shoes and chair sitting has direct consequences for the health and function of our lower body.

Awareness that our lower body is an integrated system and any interventions of isolated components will results in long term unintended systemic consequences.

Awareness that lower body health is accessible to individuals and incredibly simple.

Awareness that caring for our biology is a much better path than neglecting our bodies and waiting for it to break down.

Awareness that responsibility is the path to well being and trusting disease care experts carries significant risk.
