2. AWARENESS

“out of sight, out of mind”

It’s easy to forget about something or stop taking care of it when it isn’t visible.

If we wear shoes all the time, it’s easy to forget we even have feet let alone care for them. Feet are crucially important sensor for efficient locomotion and are grossly misunderstood by individuals and health professionals alike. 

Each foot contains 26 bones, 33 joints each with 6 degrees of freedom and in the arch of the foot alone, there are 10 muscles and 4 layers of tissue. 

As Leonardo da Vinci once said, “the human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art”. 

Nature doesn’t make mistakes. 

The level of complexity tells us that our feet are designed to be dynamic and capable of highly complex patterns of motion. 

In order to remain mobile, the articulations must articulate and in order to remain strong, the muscles must be loaded.

To understand a problem fully is to know the solution. 

Everything begins with awareness. 

Before we can begin exploring a topic, we must first 1) be aware of the topic, and 2) view the topic as relevant or important enough to deserve our time and energy. 

Our cultural blind spot around feet becomes glaringly obvious when we observe that 95% of shod people are wearing shoes that damage their feet and 75% of people develop foot issues over the course of a lifetime. 

It’s time to bring our understanding of feet into the 21st century. 

As the physical foundation for our bodies and our primary tactile sensor for the world we move upon, feet are a crucially important structure of the human form. 

Neglecting our feet is akin to neglecting the foundation of a skyscraper - a sure path to disaster. 

Ask anyone who has suffered from debilitating foot pain how important feet are and they will tell you that it’s easy to ignore feet until they stop working and we have our primary means of transportation and movement independence taken from us. 

Beyond expanding awareness that feet are important, its time to acknowledge that we currently have a disease care system that is being mislabeled as healthcare. 

Diagnosing disease and treating symptoms without addressing the root cause has nothing to do with health and is not healthcare. 

It’s time to do better. It’s time for individuals to expect better from those who serve them. 


Awareness that the footwear we choose to wear is the primary determinant of our foot health is essential. 

Without understanding the impact our footwear choices have on our foot health, it’s impossible for us to make wise choices and take care of our feet.


Efficiency means doing things right. 

Effectiveness means doing the right things. 

Many people are investing time, money and energy into improving their foot health but few people are being effective. 

Effectiveness in preventing and resolving foot dysfunction comes from consistently applying 3 core elements and by doing so, the lower body receives correct inputs that facilitate a restoration of natural health and function. 

By understanding and applying these 3 essential elements, we become empowered to prevent and resolve 99% of foot problems. 

By adopting a long term mindset, protecting ourselves from harmful footwear and implementing a consistent daily practice that includes foot reconditioning, balance training, squat restoration and time on the floor, we gain the ability to respond to any foot challenges we may encounter. 

We become empowered to take responsibility for our foot health.


Helping people understand and apply essential core behaviours is the work of the effective healthcare professional. 

Through this paper we seek to present this education framework as a new gold standard in foot health education and a template that can be adopted by health professionals in all domains to help those they serve achieve a stronger, more resilient foundation for whole body health.
