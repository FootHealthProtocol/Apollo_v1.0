ABSTRACT

- Simple, effective lower body protocol would allow individuals to reclaim responsibility for taking care of their feet without depending on professionals who have been trained to treat symptoms of foot dysfunction without addressing the root cause. 

- A paradigm shift is currently underway in how we think of health broadly and foot health specifically. Instead of simply diagnosing problems and treating symptoms (disease care), professionals are beginning to help their patients and clients take better care of themselves (healthcare). 

- This shift is a much needed change to help us move towards better health. Optimal health is the output of exposing our bodies to natural behaviours that align with our biology. 

- Within the domain of foot health, it is the duty of care and responsibility of health professionals to protect those they serve from the harmful effects of unnatural footwear. 

- By increasing awareness, respecting first principles, focusing on the essentials and designing aligned incentives, we have an opportunity to prevent and resolve the vast majority of foot dysfunction. 

We believe a low time preference, reducing time spent in unnatural footwear annd chair sitting, and a consistent daily session are fundamental requirements to restore healthy feet and a resilient, functional lower body.

5. INPUTS

- “we are how we move”

- The health and function of our bodies is a direct reflection of how we use our biology.

- According to first principles, when the body is exposed to natural inputs, the result is natural outputs.

- Converselt when the body is exposed to unnatural inputs, the result is unnatural outputs.

- Health and resilience are natural outputs.

- Sustained pain and disease are unnatural outputs. 

- the two primary natural inputs required by the lower body for foot health are varied movement and load.

- Our primitive biology is optimized for a world where humans are barefoot, walk extended distances each day on foot and are consistently exposed to a wide variety of surfaces.

- These natural behaviours create varied loads and movement positions which serve as inputs for our lower body system.

- The mismatch between the modern world today and the primitive world to which human biology is adapted for is what creates problems.

- The human body adapts impartially and unapologetically to the inputs provided to it and doesn’t care if the result is pain and dysfunction.

- Human feet require varied movement and load in the lower body to remain functional, strong and resilient.

- Despite being an incredibly important topic to understand as children, most are tought very little about health and how to care for our biology through the lifestyle we choose to live.

- Unnatural shoes and excessive chair sitting disrupt exposure to varied movement and load that are required for healthy feet.



8. RESPONSIBILITY

- The price is health is responsibility. 

- Individuals must accept that their personal health is their responsibility 

- In order to do better as a community of professionals, we must first unlearn information that no longer aligns with healthcare, and update our understanding so we can build our ability to effectively guide those we serve towards better health. 

- Within the context of foot health, we must understand the effects of our footwear choices on foot health and advocate wearing footwear that supports a healthy foundation. 

- As individuals, our health is fundamentally our responsibility. 

- As health professionals, our responsibility to those we serve is to offer truthful, helpful, applicable education that empowers them to make wise lifestyle choices.
