Protocol application primitive for a physiotherapist

- I run apollo on my own body
- I apply the protocol with my patients. I advocate for low time preference, eliminating unnatural footwear and comitting to a daily upgdrade session
- I mention the protocol to my colleagues and network of professionals
- I advertise that we integrate Apollo in our clinic
- I'm listed as a vetted Pro on the protocol application database
- I partner with a footwear partner that offers me a comission on natural footwear referalls
- Patients on my caseload purchase 500-800 pairs of natural shoes per year which earns me $6,000 - $9,600 annually
- I advocate that my university integrates the protocol into their curriculum
- I present the protocol to medical and rehab centers
- I share Apollo with doctors who refer to me and let them know that my treatment approach aligns with the protocol
