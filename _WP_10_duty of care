10. DUTY OF CARE

It is the duty of health professionals to care for those they serve. 

Caring means understanding the most current information and protecting individuals from behaviours that harm their health. 

By providing truthful, applicable education, we enable them to make wise choices and take better care of their bodies. 

Within the context of foot health, our primary duty is to protect them from the dangers of unnatural footwear that disables, deforms and damages their feet. 

Failing to advocate natural footwear is a failure in upholding our duty of care. 

When we learn better, we do better. 

Regardless of our current perspective when it comes to feet, we owe it to those we serve and are duty bound to constantly upgrade our understanding and to base our guidance on the most truthful protocol that respects fundamental laws of biology.




RAW:
- As a community of health professionals, it's our duty to do better and to protect our patients from the harmful effects of unnatural footwear instead of simply treating the symptoms created by shoes that disrespect our biology.

- Best practices are a standard or a set of guidelines that are known to produce good outcomes if followed. Assessing our patients barefoot, educating them about natural footwear and warning them about the dangers of unnatural footwear are the simple yet effective best practices that enable us to achieve good outcomes. Itâ€™s no longer acceptable to ignore foot health. A simple 60 second conversation can dramatically change a persons understanding of how to care for their feet and empower them to protect themselves from potentially debilitating foot problems in future.
