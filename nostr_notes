Hello NOSTR üëãüèΩ

We‚Äôre building a free & open source foot health protocol so everyone can restore healthy, strong, painfree feet

Trusting disease care professionals (3rd party intermediaries) who treat symptoms without ever addressing the root cause is silly

We‚Äôre building the protocol in the open on top of #Bitcoin & #NOSTR

Our mission: develop a simple foot health protocol that can be applied by individuals to effectively restore healthy feet
Why?

Because 75% of shod people develop foot problems at some point in their lives

Because fiat incentives in disease care are broken. Professionals are trained and paid to treat symptoms without ever acknowledging or addressing the root cause of issues

Because people deserve truthful information that empowers them to take better care of their bodies

Because 95% of shod people are literally wearing shoes that disable, damage and deform their feet

The core problems we‚Äôre solving:

Problem 1: 95% of shoe wearing people are unknowingly wearing shoes that damage their feet

Problem 2: When people develop foot pain/injury, they trust ‚Äúexperts‚Äù to fix the problem but these [disease care] professionals are trained and financially incentivized to treat symptoms without ever addressing the root cause which is primarily shitty shoes

We‚Äôre dematerializing foot disease care with an open source protocol that helps people take care of their feet so they can prevent and cure foot issues

This protocol can also be adopted by professionals who want to do better for their patients

The protocol doesn‚Äôt include anything novel or groundbreaking. 

It‚Äôs effectiveness comes from helping people focus on core behaviours that matter most and trimming all the fiat disease care noise
