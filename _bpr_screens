Movement screens reference

Objective: Assess lower extremity movement capacity


WHY are screens useful? Because they uncover hidden deficits that can be corrected before they cause problems

HOW do screens uncover hidden deficits? Because they are honest measures of functional capacity that cannot be cheated with compensatory patterns

WHAT is a screen? A simple movement assessment tool that is hard to cheat, highly informative and makes invisible deficits visible

Three highly useful screens that tell us virtually everything we need to know about someone’s lower body capacity are:

- Sit and rise
- Single leg balance
- Resting squat position 


---> Sit and rise:

Prompt: 
- Begin standing barefoot on firm ground
- Slowly lower down to the floor and rise again to standing without using your hands

Scoring: Binary, YES (can complete without pain) or NO (cannot complete, can complete but with pain)

Observations:
- 


---> Single leg balance



---> Resting squat position 

Context:
- The ability to lower into and out of a resting squat position demonstrates functional capacity in the lower body. 
- The resting squat position serves as a master screen that measures baseline capacity the the feet, ankles, knees and hips. It also assesses pelvic control. 
- The inability to lower into and out of a resting squat position is an indicator that something fundamental is missing within the lower body system.

Prompt:
- Begin barefoot on firm level ground standing hip width apart with feet parallel
- Slowly lower down into a resting squat position without changing foot position or letting your heels lift up off the ground
- Stay in a comfortable, relaxed resting squat for 30 seconds while taking deep, calm breaths

Scoring: Binary - Yes or No
- YES: abile to complete the screen with no pain

Standard: The ability to slowly lower into a resting squat position, maintain it comfortably for 30 seconds and then slowly rise out of the squat with no pain

Athlete standard: 2 minutes

To restore ability to complete this screen, spend time everyday in a resting squat position (assisted as needed with counterbalance, elevated heels, support assist)



While the inability to lower into a resting squat doesn't tell us exactly what isn't functioning, it does tell us that there is a restriction within the lower body system


Qualitative and quantitative scoring

Observations:


RAW:
---> Resting squat

Prompt: 
- Barefoot on flat, hard ground
- Stand hip width apart with feet parallel and slowly lower down into a resting squat position while keeping feet parallel and heels on the ground
- Spend 2 minutes in the bottom position while taking deep, calm breaths

Questions to ask:
- Do you have any pain?
- What are you feeling?
- What is stopping you from being able to get down into the resting squat?
- Can you take deep, easy breaths?

Qualitative elements: What restrictions are present (pain, ankle mobilty, hip mobility, quad dominance)
- Observations: pelvic position, toes and tibialis anterior activity

Quantitative score: binary yes (they can do it) or no (they cannot do it)

Standard: ability to remain in a deep resting squat position for 2 minutes without strain, pain and while being able to take deep, easy diaphragmatic breaths

RAW:
The resting squat is a beautiful master screen for pelvic control, hip mobility, hip stability, ankle mobility and foot function. You can’t cheat it and it serves as a brutally honest measure of lower body capacity and foundational movement capacity.

Squat: beginning from a standing position, barefoot with feet hip width apart and parallel, slowly lower down into a resting squat position and stay there for 30 seconds

To walk on two legs you need to be able to balance on one. Poor balance leads to reduced mobility, increased risk of injury and increased joint stress. Balance is easy to take for granted but it’s super important and for many people, is severely degraded because of chair use.  

Balance screen: barefoot on a flat, hard surface, stand on 1 leg and balance for 60 seconds while counting the number or errors made. If that is doable, do the same thing with eyes closed. 

These screens are simple to explain and do and it’s very hard to cheat or compensate to hide deficits. 

There is no good or bad score on a screen, there is only reality and a starting point. Doesn’t matter how you do, what matters is what you do to address deficits that the screen showed you. 

We plan to offer screens in store to every customer that walks in. We also hope everyone who reads this screens themselves, family members, friends and if you’re a pro, screen every patient and client you work with. 

How to address restrictions and deficits is the topic for another day.
