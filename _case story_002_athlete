Profile: Amateur pickleball athlete

I'm an amateur pickleball player aspiring towards a low time preference professional pickleball career. 

I run Apollo to improve my performance and durability as an athlete.

I have a history of low back, knee and ankle injuries which have been limiting factors in my training

I incorporate protocol essentials into my training and have found major benefit in my athleticism, training capacity and agility on the court.

Here are the major elements:
- I think long term with my training. My goal is to get 1% better everyday and be able to compete in pickleball until I'm 90
- I save in bitcoin and decentralize my sponsorship model by receiving zaps over nostr directly from my fans instead of receiving fiat from big companies
- I don't wear any unnatural footwear. I play in the Tolos Archetype 1.0 shoe and spend time barefoot everyday. My everyday shoe is the Shamma warrior sandal
- I have a ground living home. No chairs or couches. If I need to sit in chairs for travel, I spend 5 minutes restoring hip mobility and balance for every 1 hour of sitting
- I do tempo squats everyday and spend at least 5 minutes in a resting squat everyday
- By taking care of my body, I spend less time and money on rehab and have more time to spend with my family
