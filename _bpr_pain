Pain education reference

Objectives: 
- Educate individuals about pain and why it serves as a useful guide that must be listened to instead of an enemy to be muted
- Help individuals develop a healthy, collaborative relationship with pain

Key points to cover:
- Pain is a beneficial signal that guides us towards making better choices
- Pain does not necessarily equate to tissue damage
- Reducing pain is a consideration but never the objective
- By restoring natural function we eliminate pain
- By muting pain we disable our ability to resolve injury and often allow ourselves to make problems worse over time
- A daily pain log is a useful tool to qualify pain and measure progress over time (more info below)

Directives:
- View pain as a teacher to be learned from, not an enemy to be feared
- Create a daily pain log to track progress over time

-------
Qualifying pain:
- Location: where is the pain? (single location vs. general area)
- What is the nature of the pain? (sharp, dull, achy)
- How intense is the pain? Intensity: from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most intense pain ever felt)
- What worsens the pain? (activities, movements, positions)
- What reduces the pain? (activities, movements, positions)
- How much time is required for the pain to settle?
