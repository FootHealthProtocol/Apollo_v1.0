8. RESPONSIBILITY

Responsibility can be defined as our ability to respond. 

The ability to effectively respond to a problem first requires an understanding of the problem. 

In order to do better as a community of professionals, we must first unlearn information that no longer aligns with healthcare, and update our understanding so we can build our ability to effectively guide those we serve towards better health. 

Within the context of foot health, we must understand the effects of our footwear choices on foot health and advocate wearing footwear that supports a healthy foundation. 

As individuals, our health is fundamentally our responsibility. 

As health professionals, our responsibility to those we serve is to offer truthful, helpful, applicable education that empowers them to make wise lifestyle choices.


Health professional is defined as any individual who earns the majority of their income from helping others improve their health. 

It is the responsibility of these individuals to be informed, and to offer guidance that helps those they serve make better decisions in their day to day lives. 

Based on that definition, health professionals include movement coaches, yoga instructors, physicians, physiotherapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, podiatrists and many more professions who aspire to empower those they serve with information that guides healthy behaviour change.


In order to be effective and preserve a reputation of competence, disease care professionals will be required to shift their approach to align with the health care paradigm that has begun to emerge. 

As health professionals we must elevate our understanding of feet and the effects of footwear choices so we can help our patients effectively respond to the challenge of foot dysfunction.
