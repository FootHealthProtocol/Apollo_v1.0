- Develop a Bitcoin strategy
- Help get the Bitcoin strategy approved by CFO, CEO, board of directors
- Build a Bitcoin team
- Execute Bitcoin strategy

- Curate education resources for the business
- Primary role is to educate key players of the organization
- Coordinate signing ceremonies
- Develop custom security protocols
- Portfolio design (UTXO management, consolidation)


Bitcoin strategy considerations:
- Balance sheet strategy as a treasury asset
- Custody framework (create a report outlining tradeoffs and choose optimal strategy with key decision makers)
- PL strategy to accept sats as a method of payment (work through legal, finance implications)

Best Practices:
- Self custody
- Never disclose how many sats are in our treasury
- Never disclose our key management strategy or keyholder identities
- Use FOSS signing devices
